# @depends on:

# Print an throwmark with a message, and stop and replace the
# spinner if it's running (relies on the spinner being the last
# thing printed)

# Usage:
#   throw [options] text
# Options:
#   [same as pen.sh]
# Examples:
#   throw "Failed, world!"
#   throw bold "Failed, world!"
#   --or--
#   spin "Installing dependencies..."
#   sleep 2
#   throw "Did you forget to feed the cat?"
throw() {
    # If there is a spinner running, stop it and clear the line
    if spinning; then
        spop
        upclear
    fi

    pen -n red "${_cross:-âœ—} "
    pen "$@"
